TestNG and JUnit (tools)--> shortcuts.

Begun with unit testing approach.

Easily test in a framework which integrates perfectly with Selenium.
(TestNG) Advantages:
1. Annotations to use and understand when building test scripts
2. Test cases can be grouped. (We can group by class)
3. Generate Reports (The reporting for TestNG, instead we use  different tool)
4. Parallel testing.


@Annotations -->
- are instructions for our JVM
- carry information and some procedure for how a test should instructions

@Test --> the method below is a test case(this way we can run the test case, make it runable)

@BeforeMethod, @AfterMethod( scope is locked inside a class unless inherited )
Before or After every test case run the following code.

@BeforeClass, @AfterClass
Before every class run the following code.
