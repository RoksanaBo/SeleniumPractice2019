TestNg and JUnit tools --> shortcuts

Begun with unit testing approach.


Easily test in a framework which integrates perfectly with Selenium.


TestNG Advantages:
1. Annotations to use and understand when building test scripts
2. Test cases can be grouped (we can group by class)
3. Generate Reports (the reporting for testng, instead we use different tool)
4. Parallel testing ( run several tests at the same time)
5. Simple verifications (Assert class)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@Annotations:
are instructions for our JVM. They carry information and some procedure for how a test should run.


@Test:
The method below is a test case. This way we can run test case. Make it runnable.


@BeforeMethod, @AfterMethod (Scope is locked inside a class unless inherited)
We use them with every test case. Before or after every test case run the following code.



@BeforeTest, @AfterTest
Require knowledge of testNG xml testing


@BeforeClass, @AfterClass
Before every class run the following code.



@BeforeGroup, @AfterGroup
Before or after every group run the following code.



@BeforeSuite, @AfterSuite
Require knowledge of testNG xml testing

Clarification:

@BeforeMethod   vs    @BeforeGroup:

               @Test
               public void test1(){
                  sout("Hello")
               }


               @Test
               public void test2(){
                  sout("World")
               }


               @BeforeMethod
               public void setup(){
                   sout("Test 1")
               }

                                                             @BeforeGroup
                                                             public void groupSetup(){
                                                             sout("Testing group 1")
                                                             }


               Console output: @BeforeMethod:
               Test 1
              (test1) Hello

               Test 1
               (test2) World
           -------------------------
               Console output: @BeforeGroup:
               Testing group 1
               Test 1
               (test1) Hello

               Test 1
               (test2) World
