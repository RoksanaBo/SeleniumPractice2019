xpath
	absolute
	must start from root element:
		/html/body/div/
	relative
		you can start from any node
		//tagName[@attribute=‘value’]
		if there are couple of children with same parameters, we can use indexes,
		to get specific one.
		//tagName[@attribute=‘value’][index]
		indexes start with 1
		if there are couple of elements, under same xpath, and they are not siblings, use following xpath:
		(//tagName[@attribute=‘value’])[index]
		to find element by text:
		//tagName[text()=‘Some text’]
		partial text:
		//tagName[contains(text(),‘Partial’)]
		//span[@title=‘Date’]/following-sibling::div[1]
		//span[@title=‘Type’]//following-sibling::div[1]
		//div[@class=‘main-ui-select-inner-label’ and text()=‘Posts’]
		To go to parent element:
		/..
