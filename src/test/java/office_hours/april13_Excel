Data Driven Testing (DDT)  --> Not hard coding the variables into the code

Example : You do not store login credentials into your test script

   ** A best practice in testing is to separate test data from test script
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   1000 credentials we have to test:

    {Less Favorable} Way 1: Form a variable and constantly change the variable and run the test
    {Less Favorable} Way 2: Creating 1000 test classes
    {More Favorable} Way 3: Separate Test data and call into the test script:

          1. Data provider ---> one test case being fed all the different credentials in a
                                sequential order
          2. Excel File --> one test case being fed all the data
          3. CSV --> one test case being fed all the data
          3. Database  --> one test case being fed all the data
          4. Cloud Storage --> one test case being fed all the data

  Excel Connection is done by a third-party add-on --> Apache

  (DO NOT RE-INVENT THE WHEEL)(PICK FROM A RELIABLE SOURCE)
  ---------------------------
      To make the excel connection without reinventing the wheel
      we will import the apache excel library
