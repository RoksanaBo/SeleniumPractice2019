First day at work:

1. install Git and check the version on terminal:
      to check that you will need to say  git --version

2. clone the project :
      open Git Bash in the directory where you want to save your project:
      - git clone githubURL

3. open the project in IntelliJ

4. create your own branch in GitHub - feature/Roksana

5. create your own branch in your local machine
   - go to terminal in intelliJ
   - git branch feature/Roksana

   Make sure the name of your local and remote repository is the same.

6. switch to owr local branch
   - git checkout feature/Roksana

7. check that you are in correct branch
   - git branch

8. you did some changes in the code

9. you need to add (if you created new files)
    - git add (name of the file)  ,
    - git add . (add all files)
    - git add .java (add all unstaged java classes)
    or during the time you created the file,
    you answer yes on question "Do you want to add following file to Git?"
