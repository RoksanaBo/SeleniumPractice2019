StaleElementReferenceException - means that selenium cannot find previously located element.
It happens when you are trying to interact with element after page refresh or navigation.


                          INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:

1.WHAT IS StaleElementReferenceException? -->

- if it occurs, you need to find element again.

if it generates exception once in a while,
put it into try/catch and try to find element one more time
try{

  driver.findElement(By.id("name")).click()

}catch( StaleElementReferenceException e){
  driver.findElement(By.id("name")).click()

}


2.WHAT HAPPENS IF ELEMENT WASN'T FOUND, IN CASE OF findElement? -->
  NoSuchElementException


3.WHAT HAPPENS IF ELEMENTS WEREN'T FOUND, IN CASE OF findElements? -->
  nothing, you will get empty list.


4. HOW TO CHECK IF ELEMENT DOES NOT EXIST ANYMORE/ JUST DOESN'T EXIST? -->
   check if collection is empty:
        if(driver.findElements(By.id("name")).size()==0)){
            element doesn't exist!
        }

   You can use findElements method to find 0+ elements. In case of find element - only 1 element.
   If there is no element by given locator - NoSuchElementException

11.How to handle SSL issues in selenium?   ex: "Your connection is not private"
   - use :
     ChromeOptions chromeOptions = new ChromeOptions();
     chromeOptions.setAcceptInsecureCerts(true);

     driver =new ChromeDriver(chromeOptions) --> provide chromeOptions object into chromeDriver constructor

ChromeOptions - use to customize browser for tests

12.You have 500 test cases but the client asked you to run only 40 of them for smoke test. How will you do this?

    So we use xml runners to create suites of tests and we already have xml runner for the smoke test.
    In my framework, we group test scripts based on modules. So for every module we have a corresponding package
    with test scripts.
