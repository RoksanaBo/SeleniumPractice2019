Git {
              'origin' keyword in git is referring to remote repository (Github, BitBucket)

      How to MERGE in git examples:
--------------------
     Example 1.  Merging into master

            First Way: We use merge:
                To merge a branch into master: (Adding new code into master)
                Step 1: Make sure you are on master  branch
                Step 2: Write the following :   git merge <BranchName>
                **This will merge <branchName> into master (master is changing)

            Second Way:  We use rebase:
                To merge a branch into master: (Adding new code into master)
                Step 1: Make sure you're on <branchName>  branch
                Step 2: Write the following :   git rebase master
                **This will merge <branchName> into master  (master is changing)
​
---------------------
      Example 2. Merging master into another branch
​
           To merge master into a different branch : (Getting code from master)
              Step 1: Make sure youre on the <branchName>
              Step: Write the following : git merge master
              **This will merge master into <branchName>  (<branchName> is changing)
