Design pattern - it's like reusable solution for commonly occurring problem.
Its about how to put all codes together.

There are 3 categories of patterns:
- creational patterns  - singleton
- structural patterns
- behavior patterns

Singleton - easiest design pattern ever. We use Singleton to define our web driver object in the one place
and use it everywhere.

the design is very simple:
- you create public static object,
- make your constructor private
- and create public static getter method to get that instance
