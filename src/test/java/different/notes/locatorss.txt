	Agenda:
		TestNG
		Locators: Xpath CSS Selector

 Question?
You have 500 test cases but the client asked you to run only 40 of them for smoke test. How will you do this?
So we use xml runners to create suites of tests and we already have xml runner for the smoke test.
In my framework, we group test scripts based on modules. So for every module we have a corresponding package
with test scripts.


  test Suite - collection of certain test cases.

under tests package create a package called “vyTrack” -->
under this package create a package called “login”

in css selector, you can move from parent to child element (node),
but you cannot mode from child to parent like in xpath.


XPATH
//div[@class=‘example’]/div  - go to div element, that is direct child of this element (only one step down)
//div[@class=‘example’]//div - go to div element, that is any child (grand child, grand grand child)
                               of this element (no limit for stepping down)


CSS SELECTOR
div[class=‘example’] > div - go to div element, that is direct child
   of this element (only one step down). Grater (>) symbol.

div[class=‘example’] div - go to div element, that is any child (grand child, grand grand child)
   of this element (no limit for stepping down). Just space
