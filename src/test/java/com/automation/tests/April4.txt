############################################################################

    Data Driven Testing (DDT) - it's when your test data is separate from your code.
    Basically, you don't store test data in variables. Where this data can be stored?
    In excel and  csv files, in database. In terms of cucumber bdd framework - feature files.
    To read excel files, there is java library that calls apache poi. We gonna cover it in this
    course. In terms csv files, it's a plain text file where values are separated by comma.

    To read it, you can use Scanner. But, there are more advanced libraries, like Open CSV.
    To connect from java to data base, there is JDBC api.
    Why do we need DDT? It allows us to run same script with different test data.
    TestNG natively supports DDT through Data Provider.
    Data Provider - allows to run same test multiple times with different test sets.
    For example: you have tests cases where you to create cars. And you need to create like
    20 of them. Steps are the same, the only difference is - test data. So instead of creating
    20 identical test scripts, we can just create a one, and supply that test with a test data
    from data provider.

org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchSessionException: Session ID is null. Using WebDriver after calling quit()?

 - create page object inside a test itself

 Framework that implements Data Driven Testing calls - Data Driven Framework

    testng xml runners

testng.xml --> xml file that is used to create test suits.

xml - file extension, for example pom.xml file

what's the name of testng xml runner file?

Name can be anything, like: smoke.xml, regression.xml, fleet.xml, but default name is: testng.xml.
how many xml runners we can create? as many as we need.
what are the requirements for xml runner file?

    first of all, it should start with one line, that specifies document type:

<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "https://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd" >
