Web application has 2 sides: front-end and back-end. Front-end is used to display information to the end user.
You can see front-end in browser. When you open some website. End-user never face back-end. Because back-end is for
business logic, for storing data. It's not useful for user.

Database - used to store electronic information.

3 Tier Architecture:
 -  presentation layer - presents information --> Client  (UI) we use HTML,CSS, JavaScript
 -  application layer - business logic        --> server           Java, C# , C++, Python, Ruby
 -  data layer - used to store information.   --> database         Oracle, Mongo, MySQL
    If its relational database, info is stored in tables. Because there are 2 types of database:
    relational and non-relational. In non-relational - info is stored in JSon files, xml files,

API is whats between these 3 layers.

Any kind of info is data. It should be stored somewhere, where it is secure, easy to read, easy and fast to update.
In databases we store data in an organized manner. Database is a systematic collection of data.

Relational database system - data is stored in tables. In rows and columns. Tables are relate to each other .
Primary key - unique value of every table. Based on primary key we can join tables, when we need to get data
from 2 or more tables. Tables are related to each other using primary and foreign keys.

In non-relational database there is no tables.


in case of json- json can have different structure. Json is mostly used for web services . Communication between
UI and web services is done by json. Json - java script object notation language. Json is used to describe object.

whats the different between json and javaScript:
- json has only properties (objects, arrays, first name,last name etc.  ),no functions(no methods)
- in java object can have properties and behaviour.

If you wanna convert your java object into json- it calls serialization. For this there are specific libraries.
Json is a plain text file,easy to read. There are some libraries to convert json into object.

Database Management System - software(program) that creates maintains and organize database. We can communicate with
tables . It takes query , process them and gives us back  some data, result. It can update, delete, add, etc. It's
like a manager of our information. Database Man. System has very important functions: it responsible for backups.
If something goes wrong, and data will be lost, we can get it from backup.

RDBMS - category of database management system, that are for relational databases.
RDBMS - relational database management system. It supports SQL. SQL - language that we use to interact with database.
------------------------------------------------
SQL - structured query language, used to
- retrieve data from a database
- write data into a database
- update/delete data
- create/update /delete tables
- create/update /delete users ...

SQL is used to interact with RDBMS(SQL Server, Oracle) We write query (command) to get something from db , to add,
update, delete, change db structure, add new table, columns, users..

SQL is a hybrid language:
- Data Query Language DQL
- Data Definition Lang. DDL
- Data Control Lang. DCL
- Data Manipulation Lang. DML - used to manipulate with data

Query - a set of instructions. Tells database what to do.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

DML - according to some sources- SELECT command belongs to DQL (Data Query Language).

commands:
SELECT - (belongs to DQL) - used to retrieve data from database. not to delete or insert.just to get some data.
SELECT clause -used to specify what kind od data you want to retrieve from database.Also we can filter search results.
SELECT DISTINCT - returns only unique values.
SELECT WHERE - to filter result set,
SELECT COUNT - returns number of some things,
ORDER BY : ASC -ascending or DSC - descending.
BETWEEN - to specify range in search   указать диапазон в поиске
ROUND - how many digits after dot (select round(avg(salary), 2)-> how many decimal we wanna see.If you don't spacify
        any number, output will be without decimals
SUM - add all rows and shows sum
GROUP BY - to calculate min man average sum for each group individually
HAVING - when we use group by we need to use having to filter results
MINUS - anything that is present in both queries will be removed, and result set will contain only data
        that is left from first query. Nothing from second query will go to output.
INTERSECT - only values that are present in both queries (same) will be displayed in result set.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
CREATE TABLE - command to create out own table.
       CREATE TABLE cybertekb15 (
           student_id number(4) PRIMARY KEY,
           first_name varchar2(50) NOT NULL,-- 50 characters allowed maximum
           last_name varchar2(60) NOT NULL, -- 60 characters maximum
           start_date date,
           gender char(1) CHECK (COL IN ('M', 'F'))

---------------------------------------------------------------------
INSERT - command will add people to the table.
        INSERT INTO cybertekb15 (student_id, first_name, last_name, start_date, gender)
        VALUES ('1', 'Andrea', 'Krizbai', SYSDATE, 'F');

DELETE - specify what exactly must be deleted and then delete.

DDL


DML


For this we use WHERE clause:
SELECT *
FROM table name
WHERE salary > 4000;
---------------------------------------------------

Regular expression - REGEX - represents some text pattern.
