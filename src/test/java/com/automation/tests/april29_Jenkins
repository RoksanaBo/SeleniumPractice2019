Jenkins is used not only for application deployment, but also for running automation scripts. Because our
project is based on maven. And Maven has a lifecycle.Jenkins use Maven to build your code. And it use git
to pull your project from gitHub. Jenkins doesn't have its oun tools. We need to install them. Jenkins and
intelliJ can run project.Both of them use java. in Jenkins we can schedule our test. jenkins can continuously
listen to your commands and then start test. It has triggers. Jenkins doesn't interact with intelliJ. Jenkins
requires JDK to execute java projects. Jenk is very flexible built automation tool. the main explanation-
Jenkins is Continuous Integration, Cont Depl. and Cont.Delivery.

Continues Integration: dev-r committed some comments to github. Jenkins is continuesly listens to devs project.
Once new code was committed, jenkins takes that code and runs Unit,Integration tests,sonarQube(program scanning),
If everything was successful, jenkins will deploy new build to Test environment.Here we run smoke, regression and
performance tests. Then goes Staging Ent-t. Then UAT test and then Production environment-->Release.

Once new build is deployed,smoke test runs automatically.

VPN - virtual private network .All servers will be always within vpn.
VPC - virtual private cloud(it's about AWS)

Application Server - program that runs a web application and makes it available over the browser.
For example: Tomcat, Jetty, Jboss, Apache
--------------------------------
Question: what is the main advantage of making it available on the browser if we all have it on github?


Jenkins - used for CI/CD. Jenkins is a CI/CD tool.
CI - Continues Integration
CD - Continues Delivery & Continues Deployment

Continues Deployment = Continues Delivery + Continues Integration

Continues Delivery = Continues Integration + automated execution of end-to-end tests,
                     performance tests and delivering build to the staging environment.

        String env = "qa2"; <<< by default we use qa2 env for tests
        if, we specify different command with maven goal -Denv=qa3
        if (System.getProperty("env") != null) {
            //read env type from terminal  -Denv=qa1
            env = System.getProperty("env"); // qa1
        }
        String URL = ConfigurationReader.getProperty(env); //qa1
------------------------------------------------------------
If property wasn't created, it will null.

In our project, we use Jenkins as a CI/CD tool.

::: QUESTION ::: How often do you run regression?
Before release. / Once per sprint

::: QUESTION ::: When is release?/ What's release cycle?
Every sprint (every 2 weeks), every month or every 2 months or every 3 months or
every spring and fall months, in case of my project.

my project was 500.000 lines of code
mac os 80 million lines of code
windows xp - 40 million lines of code

Underpinning the F-35â€™s unrivaled capabilities is more than 8 million lines of software code
----------------------------------------------------
The purpose of regression test suit is to make sure that newly developed features didn't brake
existing code.That's why regression suit contains all test cases (except smoke test scripts).
Regression testing is must before release to ensure that application is working properly from
the functional perspective. Regression doesn't cover performance of security aspects of the application.

How to run regression?
First of all, it never runs locally, only from Jenkins.Then, we need to have created regression job.

job has stages:
1. Get the project code from github
2. Trigger tests: clean test -P Regression
   In our project, we have a profile for regression. It runs all features in parallel.
3. Generate cucumber report
4. Send email notification (optional)
If you need to run regression on different browser, we can crate multiple jobs for different browser:
  - Vytrack regression chrome ---> browser type will different clean test -Dbrowser=chrome -P Regression
  - Vytrack regression firefox ---> browser type will different clean test -Dbrowser=firefox -P Regression

You don't decide where to run regression, you will know from project manager (management).
Smoke test is used to ensure that application is up and running and critical components are working.
It runs every morning and after new build is deployed to test environment.
Smoke test MUST be executed after release in the production environment.
