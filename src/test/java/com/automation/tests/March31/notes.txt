Agenda:
    Take a screenshot
    Extent report --> pretty HTML report that can be added to your test automation framework.


  Indicates a driver that can capture a screenshot and store it in different ways.
  <p>
  Example usage:

  <pre>
  File screenshotFile = ((TakesScreenshot) driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
  String screenshotBase64 = ((TakesScreenshot) driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.BASE64);
  </pre>

  @see OutputType


 In Selenium WebDriver there is an interface that is responsible for screenshots.

 TakesScreenshot --> only one method, getScreenshotAs.

This method, will be used to take a screenshot whenever something fails in our code.
We can put a condition into @Aftermethod --> if test fails -> take a screenshot, save it and
later on attach to the HTML report. Report it's our evidence file. Especially, when we are
running big suits of tests, like regression, it's gonna be very difficult to demonstrate test
results without HTML report.
