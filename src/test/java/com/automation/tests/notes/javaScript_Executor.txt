Selenium RC was created based on JavaScript commands.

Every single website supports JavaScript. Because browsers support JS natively.

What can we do with JS:
- click on elements, get their values
- write functions instead of methods
- JS is very useful with scroll


By casting the WebDriver instance to a JavaScriptExecutor interface, we can execute the JavaScript
code in Selenium WebDriver:

JavaScriptExecutor js = (JavaScriptExecutor) driver;

In the following example, a single line of JavaScript code is executed to return the title of the page
displayed in the driver.
The JavaScriptExecutor interface provides the executeScript() method to which we need to pass the JavaScript code:

String title = (String) js.executeScript("return document.title");

We use console for JS
