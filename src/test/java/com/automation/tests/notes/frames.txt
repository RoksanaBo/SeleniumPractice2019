Frame:
We have HTML document, and we can insert another HTML document inside by using frame.
One HTML document inside another one.
The content inside Frame is not visible to selenium ,unless you jump into that frame.
If we cannot find the an element, we need to check if there is an iframe or not.

There are 2 types of frames:
- Frame --> helps to divide the page on sectors/zones
- iFrame --> to insert one page inside another one. The document can be anywhere, no need to be divided on sectors.

In Web Development, in front end development, developers use iFrame to insert advertisements --> вставить рекламу
iFrame has a document inside. iFrames - usually used to display adds. To be able to interact
with the content inside a frame, you need to switch to it.

driver.switchTo().frame(name or id) - by name or id of the frame

driver.switchTo().frame(WebElement) --> if frame doesn't have name or id,and index
                                        doesn't give accurate frame position, use webElement.
driver.switchTo().defaultContent() -->  to exit from the frame. If you don't exit, selenium will not
                                        see the content outside of this frame.

driver.switchTo().frame(index)  -->  by frame index, starting from 0. if there is only 1 frame = index will be 0,
                                      If there are 2 frames = first one will have index 0, 2nd - index 1.
                                      Counting - from top to bottom.


WebElement frameElement = driver.findElement(By.className("some frame"));
driver.switchTo().frame(frameElement);


.clear() --> to delete text



Usually all frames have id or name.
Before looking for that element, we need to jump to that frame.
You can specify : name,id, index or web element of the frame. It's like we are jumping to another layer.  слой



List<List<String>> --> nested frame
