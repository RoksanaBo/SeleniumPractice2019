Alert - pop up message. It's an Interface, that helps up to handle popup messages.
But not every single message is alert. Some of them can be generated by system, and
in this case selenium cannot handle that popup message. And sometimes popup messages
can be like another window/another HTML document.


Web developers use JavaScript alerts to inform users about validation errors, warnings,
getting a response for action, accepting an input value, and so on. Alerts are modal
windows displayed by browsers where user has to take action before processing further.
JavaScript alerts are implemented differently by browsers compared to other dialog windows
such as Print, Save, File Download, and so on.
