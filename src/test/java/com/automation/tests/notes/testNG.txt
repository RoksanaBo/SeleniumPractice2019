TestNG -tool for unit testing with library.

JUnit - very popular testing tool too.It was created before TestNG.

We used this tools to:
- provide assertions for verify
- it can generate report
- for visual representation for your test results


assertTrue:
  assertTrue(true);
  assertTrue(1==1);
  assertTrue(element.isDisplayed());


  Where to find assertions:
  mvnrepository.com --> testng --> version 6.14 for example --> copy maven dependency -->
  --> add it in pom.xml file between <dependencies>    </dependencies>
  Once we added dependency, we are ready to use testng. HOW?

  simple void method:  Unit test:

//annotation:  примечание
 @Test(description = "....")   // just a comment
    public void test(){
    }


@Test annotation used to create a test. Put it on top of the method. In case we don't use main method
and we can create lots of tests in one class.


Assert org.testng  its coming from testing, JUnit also has this class.


Assert.assertEquals(actual, expected) --> to vefify if expected result is equals to actual

If there is an error, it will throw exception.

You can compare any data types here: strings,primitives,arrays,objects
