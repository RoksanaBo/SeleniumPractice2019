Selenium WebDriver --> is used to develop test automation scripts for web based applications.

Web based applications - type of applications that are used in a browser.

Popular browsers:
* Chrome
* Firefox
* Internet Explorer (IE)
* Safari
* Edge
* Opera

The most popular is Google Chrome. In test automation we usually use google chrome only.
Google Chrome is very fast. It needs a lot of power.
In my las project I had to test on IE due to government requirements .

Selenium is open source, means free. You don't need to pay for it, but you need to know
some Java or any other alternative language to use it. I've seen some limitations of selenium
in the internet , but I believe that most of them you can overcome with some other libraries of
just java in-built libraries.
The biggest DISADVANTAGE OF SELENIUM IS synchronization. If selenium cannot find element, it gives you
exception right away. We can handle it, but sometimes it becomes biggest problem.

Driver browser --> connect our code and the browser itself. WebDriver is required by selenium .

In Selenium everything starts from WebDriver Interface. Chrome driver is a class.

ChromeDriver version has to be the same version as Chrome browser.

By default, WebDrivermanager downloads latest version.
