Basically you don't store test data in variables. Where this date cab be stored?
In excel, csv files, in databese . In terms of cucumber bdd framework - feature files.

To read excel files, there is java library that calls apache poi. We gonna cover it in
this course. In terms of csv files, it's a plain text file where values are separated by comma.
To read it, you can use Scanner. But, there are more advanced libraries, like Open CSV.

To connect from java to data base, there is JDBC api. (Java Data Base Collection)

Why do we need DDT? It allows us to run same script with different test data.

TestNG natively supports DDT through Data Provider.

Data Provider - allows to run same test multiple times with different test sets.

For example: you have test cases where you to create cars. And you need to create like 20 of them.
Steps are the same, the only difference is - test data. So instead of creating 20 identical test scripts,
we can just
