Version control - system that stores the changes, made to files and folders.

Git - resolves the issue of collaboration сотрудничество .When couple people work together on the
project at the same time . Git helps collaborate developers and estets work together + Git tracks
the changes of the project that were made .Git has the history of all changes -commit.

How to get the copy of the project:
- open the project in gitHub
- button "clone or download"
- copy the link http://git.....
- in intelliJ click  File -> New -> Project from Version Control

How to clone project manually, without intelliJ:
- open Power Shell /or git bash on Windows   (terminal on Mac):
  I use git bash:

ls -> to list directory

ls -a/or ls -l     -> to see all files, even hidden

pwd    -> print work directory

cd folderName  -> to switch to another folder (example: cd git)

mkdir folderName -> make directory

mkdir git -> you will create git folder

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

git commands are the same for everyone. Git is a command line tool
To get a copy of the project, use git clone URL

 git clone (http://.......)  paste your copied clone here


 For windows: run git bash as administrator-> right click on the program
 For mac: run command with sudo
 Instead of:
 git clone https://github.com/.......

 Use sudo:
 sudo git clone https://github.com/......


 If you wanna delete project that you've just cloned:   the terminal:
 rm nameOfTheFile or folder.

 WARNING:
 rm -f file -> force removal,don't use it if you are not sure!
 rmdir ->remove folder
 rm -rf folder/filename -> remove forcefully мощно
 clear -> to clean the terminal
 pwd -> to see where is your project located

 In IntelliJ:

 git status -> to see whats new in your project
