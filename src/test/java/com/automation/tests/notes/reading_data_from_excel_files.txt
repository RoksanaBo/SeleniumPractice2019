Reading data from excel files.
------------------------------

To open excel files we use Microsoft Office Excel or we can open them in google driver,
but you cannot open excel file as a simple text file.

In java there is a library that calls Apache POI that stands for reading and writing operations
with excel files.
It's just a jar file, that we need to add. Since we are using Maven, it's gonna be dependency.

Apache POI does not rely on Microsoft Office Excel. Its purely standalone tool.
Apache POI не зависит от Microsoft Office Excel. Это чисто автономный инструмент.
