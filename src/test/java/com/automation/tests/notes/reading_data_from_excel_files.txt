Reading data from excel files.
------------------------------

To open excel files we use Microsoft Office Excel or we can open them in google driver,
but you cannot open excel file as a simple text file.

In java there is a library that calls Apache POI that stands for reading and writing operations
with excel files.

It's just a jar file, that we need to add. Since we are using Maven, it's gonna be dependency.

Apache POI does not rely on Microsoft Office Excel. Its purely standalone tool.
Apache POI не зависит от Microsoft Office Excel. Это чисто автономный инструмент.

----------------------------------
mvn repository:

https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.poi/poi-ooxml

----------------------------------
Add this to your pom.xml:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.poi</groupId>
    <artifactId>poi-ooxml</artifactId>
    <version>4.1.2</version>
</dependency>


----------------------------------
There are 2 types of excel files:   .xls and .xlsx  , last one is newer.

---------------------------------


Workbook - excel file itself
WorkSheet - excel spreadsheet
Row - row in excel spreadsheet
Cell - cell within excel spreadsheet row

-----------------------------------

NotOLE2FileException: Invalid header signature; -- no excel file found

java.io.IOException: org.apache.poi.xssf.usermodel.XSSFWorkbookFactory not found - check if poi-ooxml-*.jar is
on the classpath. -- library wasn't downloaded. Refresh maven dependencies.
mvn dependency:tree - to download all libraries that are specified in pom.xml file

-------------------------------------------------
If you cannot download dependency , run this command --> mvn dependency:tree
