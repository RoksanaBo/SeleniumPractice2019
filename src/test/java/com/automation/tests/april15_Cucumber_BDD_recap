BDD - behavior driven development is used to write requirement documents from end-user perspective.

SO business (BA's, PO's, Dev's and Testers) can seat together and discuss requirements that are written in the
plain text.

BDD helps to fill the gap between business and technical teams.

Business requirements will be written as a user story.

Every story starts like: As a user, I want to be able to....

User story contains AC and it defines how feature should behave.

Basically what feature should be able to do and what not.

We, as testers, develop test automation scripts based on user story acceptance criteria.
             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What are the steps:
1. Read and analyze user story. If needed - ask questions during grooming sessions.
   Or we can ask questions any time, not only during the meetings.

2. Write feature file/files with test scenarios.

3. Dry run - to generate step definitions.

4. Place step definition methods  into step definition classes.

5. Allocate all required web elements and develop reqyuired methods for interaction with
   those elements.

6. Create page objects i the step definition classes and use them to provide code
   implementation for every test step. Every step (phase) defines it's behavior.

7. When everything is done, generate HTML report and push the code to github, from your
   branch, and create a pull request for code review,

8. When review is completed, you can move your task from in progress/review to column in Jira board.


How do we implement BDD in test automation? - We use Cucumber BDD.
For test cases we create .feature files. Every feature file consists of test scenarios.
Every test scenario consists of test steps. Every test step has to start with Gherkin keyword:
-Given
-When
-Then
-And
-But
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Also, feature has a description:

Feature: Create a car
        As user, I want to be able to add new cars.

Scenario: 1.Add some car
        Given user is on the landing page
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Then, composition of cucumber framework:

 pages                         page classes
 runners                       cucumber test runners. We need them to execute feature files





What if we want to run specific scenario?
We can
