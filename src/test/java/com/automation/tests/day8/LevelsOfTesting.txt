Levels of testing:

UNIT testing --> testing of smallest functional keys of the application.
                 Ex: method, class..

  In my project developers will following this flow:
     developers write a code --> unit tests to test their code -->
     --> code review--> code goes to github(for example)-->
     --> new build can be deployed to the test env --> and
     here we do functional testing . Unit testing at the very early
     stage, because it's easier to find a bug.

  Who writes unit test? for application code - developers.
  Can I write some unit tests for my automation framework? yes.


  import org.testng.annotations.Test;

@Test annotation used to create a test. Put it on top of the method.In this case,
 we don't use main method and we can create lots of tests in one class.
