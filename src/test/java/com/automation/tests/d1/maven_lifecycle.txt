Maven automates the build process of Java projects. Each phase in the build process is
known as a Maven lifecycle or a Maven goal.

Each lifecycle manage a certain part of the build process. Maven lifecycles follow each other.

A Maven lifecycle is a Maven command --> mvn verify, mvn test.
When certain Maven lifecycle given as a maven command, all life cycles that come before are executed.

LIFECYCLE:
- validate
- compile
- test
- verify

clean -remove all files generated by the previous build.

target folder - auto-generated folder by maven. Contains results of previous build. If you commit it,
someone else will pull it --> conflict, because that person has target as well, with different content.

build - is what will be created once you click on the run button.

right click on the project name --> file --> new --> .gitignore . to prevent committing of certain files/folder.
we usually don't share these files:
.idea
*.iml
target
.DS_Store

SAVE AND CLOSE THIS FILES

.idea and *.iml --> auto-generated by IntelliJ. Once you commit files, and you some other person will pull them,
it will cause git conflict.

Its not a full list of files/folders. At this point, this is what has to be ignored.

In the beginning, I always create .gitignore file before even initializing git repository.

target never present by default. It appears after executing maven goal/lifecycle.
