First of all we need to create local repository.
To create a local repository we need : in Console:

 git init  --> we run it only once in the beginning.

 git status

 git add .

 git status                                  (git status is not part of the required steps,
                                                its just help to understand what has been changed since last commit)
 git commit -m "first commit"

                               *(i took a snapshot of my code and now i am ready to send my code to github)
                               *go to github, create Repository by clicking "New" button.
