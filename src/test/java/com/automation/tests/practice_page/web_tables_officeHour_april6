Web Tables     04/06/2020

Two types of tables (in terms of selenium)
  1. Static tables
     Constant, having a FIXED number of rows and columns
     Examples: A regular calendar

  2. Dynamic tables
     Changing, the rows and columns may change.
     Example: appointments
     Make our code generic so it does not fail every time the rows
     and columns change.

  When we refer to dynamic tables we are NOT talking about its data!
-------------------------------
     In HTML a table is defined with a <table> tag

     HTML for table{
     <table>
        <tr>
          <th> --> header
       <tbody> --> refers to the body of the table( everything except header and/or footer)
          <tr> --> row )from left to right)
            <td> --> columns (from top to bottom)

     }

For tables we will usually use Xpath --> easier to see the pieces
