JavaScriptExecutor - interface that allows to execute javascript code as part of our selenium script.

JavaScript -used for front-end development and supported by every browser and website.
If, something doesn't work in selenium, we can do it with JavaScriptExecutor. For example:
click, scroll, text input.















scrolling or click , or text input does not work. if something doesn't work with selenium method,
 we use javaScript.
JS - to build frontend development.
