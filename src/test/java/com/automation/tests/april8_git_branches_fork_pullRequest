Today is April 8, 2020
           ------------------------------------------
	Agenda:
		git branches, fork and pull request

git push --set-upstream origin sdet

To create a remote branch on github that corresponds to your newly created local branch.

clone - it’s when you are getting a copy of the project from remote repository (github)
        to local repository (on your laptop)

from server --> laptop

fork - it’s when your are getting a copy of someone’s repository on your github account.

from someone’s github account ---> my github account

and these repositories will be linked, so you can create pull requests later on.

fork some project to our account --> clone project from our account --> to our laptop

when people use forks?

when you want to be a contributor of some public open source project.

In case of linux project, there are thousands of contributors, and only one branch - master.

Because, every contributor has forked project to their account.
               ------------------------------------------------------------

::::Remember:::: whenever you import new project:

	1. Setup SDK
	2. If it’s maven project, add project as maven - right click on pom.xml file --> select add as
	   maven project.

We forked project to our github account. Then, we cloned this project to our laptop.

Then, we add a new utility method. And, it’s time to commit changes:

git commit -a -m “added utility for switching windows”

this command will stage and commit files in the one shot.

git push --- to deliver these updates to the github repo. Our account yet.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Parallel testing - when 2 or more tests getting executed at the same time.

To make it possible, your driver must be capable to handle multiple threads.

If driver just singleton - it cannot be in 3 places at the same time.

To resolve this issue, we made a web driver object ThreadLocal.

ThreadLocal allows to create a copy of the object at the run time for every thread.

Also, we need to make a getDriver method synchronized to prevent a crash.

So 2 or more threads won’t conflict. It calls - thread safety.
------------------------------

To run data provider tests in parallel, add parameter:

@DataProvider(parallel = true) // to execute all tests in parallel
