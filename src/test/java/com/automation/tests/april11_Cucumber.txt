CUCUMBER

-----------------------------------------------
Java - to write a code
Intellij IDE - where we write a code
Maven - project builder tool
Selenium WebDriver - tool for automating web-based applications.
TestNG - unit, system and e2e testing framework.

------------------------------------------------

TDD Test Driven Development --> about the whole development process.

THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT TTD - requirements look like simple agile user stories.
Before writing the functionality itself, developer writes test
and then he starts writing the functionality then continues to checking if everything passing. All this unit tests,
if they passing, means everything is working.
(like repl - you cannot submit test until everything passes)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

BDD Behavior Driven Development --> entire team is involved into development process. about Agile

And into the process of discussing requirement documents. And requirement documents are
written from end-user perspective.Requirements look like a story : As a user I should be able......<--Jira story.
BDD scenarios are written based on AC.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
BDT Behavior Driven Testing

They are both about development and automated testing.

In both cases test will be written before dev-t process/code implementation.


BDD/BDT = testing the functionality from end-user perspective. So we are not
dealing with raw code.

BDD != TDD

BDD it's about UI user Interface point of view.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unit testing is also automated testing(developers).

Java unit testing tools/frameworks:  TestNG  and JUnit

-----------------------------------------------------------
Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
Test Driven Development (TDD)
Behavior Driven Testing (BDT)


They are both about development and automated testing.
In both cases, tests will be written before development process/code implementation.
In case of TDD, we are dealing with raw code.
In case of BDD/BDT = it’s about testing the functionality from end-user perspective.
So we are not dealing with raw code.

BDD it’s about UI point of view.
BDD != TDD

Java unit testing tools/frameworks: TestNG and JUnit.

-------------------------------------------------------

To implement BDD in our test automation framework we gonna use Cucumber BDD.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NEW PROJECT CREATION:

Right click on src/test/java:
	create a package: com.vytrack

Right click on vytrack --> new -> package:
	 pages
	 utilities
	 runners
	 step_definitions

Right click on src/test --> new --> directory --> resources

right click on resources folder --> mark as --> test resources root folder

Right click on src/test/resources --> new --> directory --> features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

package com.vytrack.runners;

import io.cucumber.junit.Cucumber;
import io.cucumber.junit.CucumberOptions;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
        glue = “com/vytrack/step_definitions”,
        features = “src/test/resources/features”
)
public class CucumberRunner {
}
-----------------------------------------------

    These 2 parameters are mandatory:

glue - path to the package with step definition methods.
features - path to the folder/directory with feature files.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
mac		- preferences
windows - settings

REMEMBER!!! DON’T ADD SUBSTEPS PLUGIN! IF YOU HAVE IT - DELETE IT!

You need 2 plugins only:
Cucumber for Java -- by JetBrains
Gherkin 		  -- by JetBrains

After installation, restart an Intellij.

then ,all your feature files will have a green icon

if feature file icon is blue - delete substeps plugin

If feature file icon is gray, even after installing plugins:

Check Settings->Editor->File Types. Verify that Cucumber Scenario is set to a Registered Pattern of *.feature.

command + option + esc - force quit some program

control + alt + delete - right on program --> end task
------------------------------------------------------------------------

How do we create feature files??
Right click on the features directory --> new --> file --> *.feature

#### Use Gherkin by JetBrains

There is a chance that you intellij version is too old, and plugin cannot be installed.
So you need to update intellij first.
