TDD Test Driven Development --> about the whole development process.
BDD Behavior Driven Development
BDT Behavior Driven Testing

They are both about development and automated testing.

In both cases test will be written before dev-t process/code implementation.


In case of TDD we are dealing with the raw code.
BDD/BDT = testing the functionality from end-user perspective. So we are not
dealing with raw code.

BDD != TDD

BDD it's about UI user Interface point of view.
